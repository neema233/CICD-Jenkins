# CICD-Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). It automates various stages of software development, including building, testing, and deploying applications. Jenkins supports extensive customization through plugins and enables defining workflows as code with Jenkinsfiles. It can distribute tasks across multiple machines, providing scalability and efficiency. Jenkins also offers monitoring and reporting tools to track build and deployment statuses.
